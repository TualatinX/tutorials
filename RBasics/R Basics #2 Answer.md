# R Basics #2 Answer

## Q1

Use a for loop to take the square root of each value in the following vector: `vec1 <- c(4, 9, 81, 100, 1000, 10^6)`. Save the results to a new vector called `vec2`.

**Answer:**

```r
vec1 <- c(4, 9, 81, 100, 1000, 10^6)
vec2 <- rep(NA,length(vec1))
for (i in 1:length(vec1)){
  vec2[i]<-sqrt(vec1[i])
}

vec2
[1]    2.00000    3.00000    9.00000   10.00000   31.62278 1000.00000
```

## Q2

Monte Carlo Simulation: Imagine that the values in the vector `pop` below represent vote shares for a presidential candidate across the  3,144 counties in the United States. If we were to take a sample of 50  counties and estimate mean support for the presidential candidate, would we, on average, estimate the vote share across all counties accurately? (Donâ€™t worry about the fact that we really should be weighing counties  by their population size to estimate overall support.) Draw 10,000  samples of 50 counties from `pop` and estimate mean support for each sample, saving each mean estimate into a vector called `smpl_means`. How does the mean of the sample means compare to the population mean?  Do we, on average, do a good job of estimating the population mean?

> `pop <- runif(n = 3144, min = 0, max = 1)`

**Answer:**

```r
pop <- runif(n = 3144, min = 0, max = 1)

mean(pop) # population mean
[1] 0.5052021

n <- 10000
smpl_means <- rep(NA, n)
for(i in 1:n){
  smpl <- sample(pop, 50)
  smpl_means[i] <- mean(smpl)
}

mean(smpl_means)
[1] 0.5051876
```
